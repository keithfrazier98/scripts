# Contributing to DataX
Thanks for taking the time to contribute! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer


## Report using Github's issues
If you encounter a bug, please check if the bug has already been reported. If the bug has not been reported, you can report the bug by opening a new issue


### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Great Bug Reports tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)


### Updating issues
You can contribute by adding additional information to existing issues.


### Reproducing a reported bug
You can contribute by validating an issue or adding additional context to an existing issue.
